# This is the server configuration file. Here you can set up the connection information for your server.
# This was written with the assumption that you are behind a router.
# Dumbed Down Definitions...
# LAN (LOCAL area network) - typically consists of computers connected to the same router as you.
# WAN (WIDE area network) - typically consists of computers OUTSIDE of your router (ie. the internet).
# x.x.x.x - Format of an IP address. Do not include the x'es into settings. Must be real numbers.

# Networking
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is transmitted to the clients connecting from an external network, so it has to be a public IP or resolvable hostname
# Common settings...
# 127.0.0.1 - If you are playing alone on a test server
# 192.168.x.x - This is if you are on a 192.168.x.x type network (behind a standard consumer router) and want other computers from JUST the internal network to be able to connect
# x.x.x.x - WAN IP obtained from http://www.whatismyip.com/. This is if you want people outside your internal network to be able to connect to your server.
# If this IP is resolvable by the Login Server, just leave *.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default: *

# Character name template.
# Example: CnameTemplate = [A-Z][a-z]{3,3}[A-Za-z0-9]*
# The above setting will allow names with first capital letter, next three small letters, and any (capital or not) letter or number, like OmfgWTF1
# Most rational to have CnameTemplate = [A-Z][a-z]*
# The above setting will allow names only of letters with first one capital, like Omfgwtf
